              We're stuck in a terrible loop: needs to unfulfilled, depravation brings out the worst in each of us, "responsibility" falls on the individual,
              blame and isolation compound the initial depravation. So many people are stuck in this loop, trapped as their worst selves and feeling itâ€™s their fault. Individual responsibility is scapegoating. The burden of responsibility falls on process, ensuring circumstances and systems exist to bring out the best in all of us. 
              Safety begets process, process begets safety.
