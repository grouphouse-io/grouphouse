              American community is disappearing.
              <br />
              <br />
              There is a shared but divided struggle of feeling alone, unsupported, unsafe.
              Lack of community has forced the stakes to increase in &quot;strong ties&quot; of romantic relationships, marriage, and family,
              placing extraordinary and unhealthy levels of stress on these relations.
              Social media has filled the void to offer the illusion of community while deepening the sense of isolation
              and personal dissatisfaction.
              <br />
              <br />
              The net-effect is that the people who need help most are often the least likely to get it;
              each individual faces a moral dilemma between directing their finite energy towards
              people who cannot be salvaged by their individual efforts, or using it to keep their own head above the water.
              So, everyone fends for themself, and hides their own needs out of fear of being abandoned.
              <br />
              <br />
              This brittleness and insecurity creates the conditions for implosion (depression, obesity, addiction, suicide)
              and explosion (hatred, anger, bigotry, violence). The individuals that escape these forces often had the good fortune to inherit good community.
              Community is essential to step in and stop vicious cycles where individuals can&apos;t.
              <br />
              <br />
              But where can we rebuild community?

              It&apos;s a comforting embrace. It&apos;s breaking bread among friends. A warm bed after a weary day.
              A place to drop one&apos;s burden to come back to it on a new day.

              1. Bring out the best in people.
              <br />
              People are good. People are phenomenal.
              <i> You are beautiful. </i>
              Good systems bring out the best in people. Bad systems and circumstances bring out the worst.
              The burden of responsibility falls on processes, not people.
              <br />
              <br />

              2. Build a win-win world.
              <br />
              In English there&apos;s a false dichotomy in &quot;selfish&quot; and &quot;selfless&quot;.
              The distinction suggests that needs are selfish and therefore bad. But is it bad to need water because it is &quot;selfish&quot;? Is it bad to need food?
              Is it bad to need?
              <i> Of course not. </i>
              The most beautiful things in life are both &quot;selfish&quot; and &quot;selfless&quot;: they&apos;re aligned, they&apos;re barycentric, they&apos;re win-win.
              Love is alignment. Compatibility is alignment. Good systems facillitate win-win scenarios, and win-wins bring out the best.
              <br />
              <br />

              3. All needs are legitimate.
              <br />
              Living a dignified existence is knowing our needs are legitimate and should be addressed. Moreover
              knowing our own needs are legitimate is the path to knowing others needs are legitimate as well.
              Compassion for oneself is a precondition for compassion for others.
              <br />
              <br />

              4. Know thyself. Build your own story of self.
              <br />
              Your story is profound. Your story matters. Knowing your story often means knowing your essential depravations and subsequent needs, essential abundances and subsequent securities.
              You are a piece, seeking its puzzle. Self-knowledge, self-awareness, and a bit of personal storytelling are our greatest tools to finding it.
              <br />
              <br />

              5. You are irreplaceable.
              <br />
              Knowing your story means knowing your unique needs and unique offerings. Our ideal home offers and needs you and exactly you.
              This is our guiding aspiration for what a home should be: home is finding your people, your alignment, your puzzle, and through that finding durable fulfillment and safety.
              <br />
              <br />

              6. Change starts at home.
              <br />
              The smallest steps are often the most courageous.
              This is where revelations and revolutions truly begin.
              We&apos;re rooting for you, because we&apos;re striving too.

                    Software isn&apos;t like typical work. You don&apos;t need to rebuild the wheel every time.
                    In fact, in an ideal world the only thing you would ever need to build is the logic that&apos;s essential to your
                    product. The rest can be shared from others&apos; efforts.
